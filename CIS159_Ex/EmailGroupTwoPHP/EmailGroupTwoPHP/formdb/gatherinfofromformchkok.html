<p>Note on the next page we will deal with header() and location: Remember that header() must be called before any 
actual output is sent, either by normal HTML tags, blank lines in a file, or from PHP. It is a very common error to 
read code with include, or require, functions, or another file access function, and have spaces or empty lines that 
are output before header() is called. The same problem exists when using a single PHP/HTML file.From the manual</p>
<p>You can override this event by returning false in the event handler. Use this capability to validate data on the 
client side to prevent invalid data from being submitted to the server. If the event handler is called by the 
onsubmit attribute of the form object, the code must explicitly request the return value using the return function, 
and the event handler must provide an explicit return value for each possible code path in the event handler function.</p>
